# Iruka Learn

## What is Iruka Learn?
My goal for this project is to create a fun and interesting way to learn Japanese using NHK and other Japan news. During my Japanese classes in college, we would read from NHK news as a way to warm-up, and get to know more about current events in Japan. I want to create a tool for myself and others to use this approach in an optimized way, which will include better translation for kanji and other words, quizzing, a filter ranging from Easy to Hard sources, shuffling system, and so much more. Eventually, I want to add learning objectives such as daily rewards for completing a quiz (which can unlock more articles), and determining current areas of study you want to focus on. I admittedly have not been great at keeping up with studying, so I hope this will keep me motivated!

## TODO:

### DAY 1
1. ~~Create a BS4 python file~~
2. ~~Figure out how to scrape~~
3. ~~Find element to scrape from (starting with body)~~
4. ~~Print out what I have scraped~~
5. ~~Store into a txt file instead~~

### DAY 2
1. Get the title and date (maybe image, not sure yet)
2. Store these into separate txt files
3. Create a HTML template for this
4. Start designing out specs for website (Figma w/ shadcn or Next UI?)

### DAY 3
1. Research project structure (web-app, db, bot-scraping, OpenAI API, setup.py + main.py, etc.)
2. Set up a base website to work with
3. Implement the HTML template within website
4. Create a good base project structure for the web-app 

### DAY 4
1. Build out a better project structure (with what learned from last time)
2. Research beautiful soup bot scraping
3. Finish up core design
4. Look into where to store files (online db, cloud, etc.)

### DAY 5
1. Look into using AI to automate a quiz for news
2. Figure out more on auto-translating when click on an element (use a Link tag like in Chakra?)
3. Start figuring out how to scale website to handle multiple entries
4. Figure out where to store these entries (online db/cloud)

### LATER
1. Start hosting! (iruka.lol pref domain)
2. Look into artists who can better help design
3. Figure out how to market and deploy to a large scale
4. Learn a lot about everything!
